Maintainer: Joe Doe
Description: Provides a comprehensive suite of functions for non-compartmental analysis (NCA) of pharmacokinetic data. Includes calculations for Area Under the Curve (AUC) using linear and log-linear trapezoidal methods, AUC from time 0 to infinity, maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax), estimation of the terminal elimination rate constant (lambda_z), half-life, clearance, volume of distribution, Mean Residence Time (MRT), accumulation ratio, and bioavailability. Designed for ease of use, robust error handling, and generation of publication-ready results.
